class Counter():

A tiny, persistent counter.

  * an instance-wide count   -> self.instance_count
  * a process-wide, persistent count stored in _ctr_ -> Counter._global_count

• Every process keeps its own *instance_count*.
• All processes share one global count that is written to `_ctr_` as default name.
  If you want to use the class Counter in several cases, set the '_cvar' parameter. 
  The class stores now for each new call to the class its self a further process-wide, 
  persistent counter namend as the parameter is namend.  
  

The implementation is intentionally very small – if you need
concurrency-safe increments use `fcntl`/`msvcrt` or SQLite.
